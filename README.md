Description
===========
A simple utility for MS Office 2013 Tweaking, to avoid the unsafe registry editor usage.

__Supports:__

- 2. Disable/Enable Applications Start Screen
- 3. Remove/Restore Skydrive right-click Context Menu
- 4. Customize Default Outlook Attachments Save Folder


__In details:__

[1] - MS adding a typing animation effect at MS Office 2013 to make typing appear smoother. 
But if you’re typing fast or you work on a slow machine this can be distracting and
annoying. The problem is that you can't be able to disable this effect from the MS Office
settings. To take effect the option change, you must restart the MS Office, if it's open,
or user logout maybe required.

[2] - When you open an Office 2013 program, a start screen automatically displays showing you
the various templates available and a list of recent documents opened in the left column. 
If you find this screen annoying and would rather pass it by, it’s now easy to disable.

[3] - Installing MA Office 2013 you may see a grayed out _"SkyDrive Pro"_ option in your 
context menu. This option appears whenever you right-click a file or folder, but it’s 
useless if you don’t use SharePoint. There’s no obvious way to disable this option in 
Office 2013’s interface. Now it's simple as one click!

[4] - By default, when you use the _'Save as…'_ option to save e-mail messages and attachments 
in Outlook the items are saved in your My Documents folder. Now you change that.
